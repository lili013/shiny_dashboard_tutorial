For instance, you may need to ask users to supply parameters that will be used in an analysis, connect to a backend database, or execute new R scripts as the user explores your analysis.",

abstract="In the preceding chapters, you saw how Shiny delivers interactive environments based on dynamic data. Dynamic reports and the live dashboards have many similarities. On the other hand, this chapter, because the reports end up as PDFs, is less interactive. Reports are a fact of life in many fields, and stakeholders tend to require snapshots in time rather than fully interactive environments. Through the knitr and rmarkdown packages, we create documents (for example, PDF, HTML, or Microsoft Word) based on data input. For regular reports that build on continuously changing data, yet that have the same structure overall, this is a great time-saver.",
